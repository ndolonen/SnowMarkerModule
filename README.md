# Snow Marking Module
This application is a bachelor project made to work with https://github.com/PolaricServer/webapp2<br/>
It's made by Njaal Dolonen, Nicolay Skjelbred, Jan-Magnus Solheim. 

The project was to make a marking module that could be used in Search And Rescue operations to better mark areas on the map for information.

This project was made to be as modular as possible, its therefor dependent on having A map present. if you have a map present go into drawConfig.js and edit the "var map = browser.map" line. Replace "browser.map" with the name of the name of your map.

There is also other settings in drawconfig like color settings and such which lets the user change the color of the drawTool to their needs.

An example version of the program can be found running on http://bachelor.snowcode.no. The application can be activated by pressing on the Pencil. If this goes down please contact us and we will try to bring up another version if possible.

If there are any questions or comments to the application we can be contacted at Snowmarkermodule@gmail.com

DISCLAIMER: some of the CSS files belongs to to the webapp2 application from PolaricServer. These are implemented into this project cause of necesarry testing purposes.
